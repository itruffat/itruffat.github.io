Welcome to my GitPage!


Here is a list of my repos:

> ESOLANGUAGE-STUFF
  * [BF-nomenclature project](https://github.com/itruffat/BrainF_Nomenclature):  This repository contains a project aimed at standardizing the various implementations of BrainF*ck (BF) machines. 
The goal is to address the language’s unspoken shortcoming as an otherwise perfect esolang - the reliance of most "tricks" on the specific configuration of the underlying BF machine.

  * [Jesting Lang](https://github.com/itruffat/JestingLang):  Abstract syntax, parser, and interpreter for a language designed to emulate the behavior of spreadsheet processors, from Excel to Google Sheets.
It is intended as a foundation for other applications that can run on this surprisingly powerful and expressive syntax.

  * [Whenever-Everywhere](https://github.com/itruffat/WheneverEverywhere):  This is a repository that allows the cross-compilation of the Eso Language *Whenever* into C. That way, it becomes possible to run Whenever code on any thing that has a C compiler. 
This approach ensures compatibility with nearly all computers and architectures, and as a result, we can run Whenever virtually everywhere!

> PYTHON-UTILITY
  * [Microsoft's Visual Basic Wrapper](https://github.com/itruffat/VBW):  A Python wrapper that provides a straightforward interface for interacting with Microsoft Visual Basic by launching a Butler process that listens for and executes instructions.
This is especially useful for working with Excel or Word files that contain complex structures —like splicers— which may not be properly understood (or may be damaged) by other Python libraries such as **openpyxl**.

  * [Python Free Point](https://github.com/itruffat/python_point_free):  Small library that provides a decorator to use FreePoint-like Syntax in Python natively.
> UTILITIES
  * [This Git Page](https://github.com/itruffat/itruffat.github.io):  Besides what you are reading right now, this repo contains a workflow to automatically fetch information from other github proyects on your personal git account and automatically populate your readme file.
This section of the code was created using it. For more information on how this works, please refer to `.gitpage/README.md` .
