Welcome to my GitPage!


Here is a list of my repos:

> ESOLANGUAGE-STUFF
  * [Jesting Lang](https://github.com/itruffat/JestingLang):  Abstract syntax, parser, and interpreter for a language designed to emulate the behavior of spreadsheet processors, from Excel to Google Sheets.
It is intended as a foundation for other applications that can run on this surprisingly powerful and expressive syntax.

  * [Whenever-Everywhere](https://github.com/itruffat/WheneverEverywhere):  This is a repository that allows the cross-compilation of the Eso Language *Whenever* into C. That way, it becomes possible to run Whenever code on any thing that has a C compiler. 
This approach ensures compatibility with nearly all computers and architectures, and as a result, we can run Whenever virtually everywhere!
