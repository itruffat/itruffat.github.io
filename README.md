Welcome to my GitPage!


Here is a list of my repos:

> ESOLANGUAGE-STUFF
 
  * [BF-nomenclature project](https://github.com/itruffat/BrainF_Nomenclature):  This repository contains a project aimed at standardizing the various implementations of BrainF*ck (BF) machines. 
The goal is to address the language’s unspoken shortcoming as an otherwise perfect esolang - the reliance of most "tricks" on the specific configuration of the underlying BF machine.

  * [Jesting Lang](https://github.com/itruffat/JestingLang):  Abstract syntax, parser, and interpreter for a language designed to emulate the behavior of spreadsheet processors, from Excel to Google Sheets.
It is intended as a foundation for other applications that can run on this surprisingly powerful and expressive syntax.

  * [Oh No, Another Bunch Of BF Emulators](https://github.com/itruffat/ONABOBFE4P_BrainFck_Emulators):  Strongly connected to the BF Nomenclature Project, this repo provides a configurable BF-machine that can be defined according to the user's request. 
Additionaly, hooks are available to do more powerful things, such as adding stop-points where certain characters are found.

  * [Whenever-Everywhere](https://github.com/itruffat/WheneverEverywhere):  This is a repository that allows the cross-compilation of the Eso Language *Whenever* into C. That way, it becomes possible to run Whenever code on any thing that has a C compiler. 
This approach ensures compatibility with nearly all computers and architectures, and as a result, we can run Whenever virtually everywhere!

> MISC
 
  * [Four Languages Zipper](https://github.com/itruffat/PyJSZipper4Polyglots):  Focused on creating Polyglots (programs that can run on multiple interpreters), this repo can create a file to be read by up to 4 languages - Python, Javascript, Lua and Ruby!
Functionality-wise, the zipper picks up programs in their original languages and then combines them in a very precise way so that the result will be valid in all languages.
Not a very useful thing, but a really cool one!

> PYTHON-UTILITY
 
  * [Gaming Selenium](https://github.com/itruffat/PygamingSelenium):  Using PyGaming, this library gives the user more power to interact with a selenium application and provide feedback. 
Useful when you are designing an application that either [A] needs user interaction to work (such as requiring passwords) or [B] is there to give you an alternative way to navigate a website experience.

  * [Microsoft's Visual Basic Wrapper](https://github.com/itruffat/VBW):  A Python wrapper that provides a straightforward interface for interacting with Microsoft Visual Basic by launching a Butler process that listens for and executes instructions.
This is especially useful for working with Excel or Word files that contain complex structures —like splicers— which may not be properly understood (or may be damaged) by other Python libraries such as **openpyxl**.

  * [Python Free Point](https://github.com/itruffat/python_point_free):  Small library that provides a decorator to use FreePoint-like Syntax in Python natively.

> UTILITIES
 
  * [Quick-Alias](https://github.com/itruffat/QuickAlias.sh):  Bash script that enables the quick creation and destruction of aliases on terminals. This corresponds with the nature of how I usually use aliases, needing to use them for a cuople of hours (maybe days) and then removing them.
Instead of needing to configure your terminal, the commands the script adds take care of that for you.

  * [This Git Page](https://github.com/itruffat/itruffat.github.io):  Besides what you are reading right now, this repo contains a workflow to automatically fetch information from other github proyects on your personal git account and automatically populate your readme file.
This section of the code was created using it. For more information on how this works, please refer to `.gitpage/README.md` .
