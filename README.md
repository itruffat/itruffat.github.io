Welcome to my GitPage!


Here is a list of my repos:

> ESOLANGUAGE-STUFF
  * [Whenever-Everywhere](https://github.com/itruffat/WheneverEverywhere):  This is a repository that allows the cross-compilation of the Eso Language *Whenever* into C. That way, it becomes possible to run Whenever code on any thing that has a C compiler. 
This approach ensures compatibility with nearly all computers and architectures, and as a result, we can run Whenever virtually everywhere!

> MISC
  * [This Git Page](https://github.com/itruffat/itruffat.github.io):  This repo contains a workflow to automatically fetch other github proyects and populate a page.

> PYTHON-UTILITY
  * [Python Free Point](https://github.com/itruffat/python_point_free):  Allows the use of FreePointSyntax in Python.
